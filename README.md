# TEXAM
Copy + Paste Bypasser

Below, you can find the info you need
in order to get started using Texam!

-----------------------

In order to use Texam you need to extract
the zip file onto your desktop. You should
see that all files will be in a folder
called Texam. Here you can find this file,
some other important files, and then also
the two main files. Texam.py is the main
program, but in order to work properly on
all computers (running windows os) you
need to start Texam using the Texam.ps1
file. This file runs a script that starts
Texam in powershell so that the program
doesn't run in to any permission errors.
In order to work, this program needs
access to reading and changing files wich
on some computers are not allowed by a
"non-trusted" program. Therefor we use
PowerShell, that is a trusted program, to
run the main program. If you have any
further questions, feel free to ask me at
any time on my discord or instagram. Links
down below. Thanks for using my software!
