# TEXAM
Copy + Paste Bypasser

Below, you can find the info you need
in order to get started using Texam!

-----------------------

In order to use Texam you need to extract
the zip file wherever you want. In the
texam-main folder you find this README
file, the license, and also the Texam
folder. Inside the Texam folder you
only need to know the Texam.ps1 file.
This file runs a script that starts
Texam in powershell so that the program
doesn't run in to any permission errors.
In order to work, this program needs
access to reading and changing files wich
on some computers are not allowed by a
"non-trusted" program. Therefore we use
PowerShell, that is a trusted program, to
run the main program. You can right click
the ps1 file and make a shortcut that you
can put on a more accessable place like
for example your desktop. Then you only
need to run the shortcut everytime you
want to start Texam. If you have any
further questions, feel free to ask me at
any time on my discord or instagram. Links
down below. Thanks for using my software!
